# Goal of Today

Continue working on our own compiler, two compile `ARM` to `Machine Code`.
We started to write the compiler last time in `python` and will continue so.

We will work on the `Parser` to parse Lines. If lines containe jumps, we will parse a reference call back. That is atleast the plan.
